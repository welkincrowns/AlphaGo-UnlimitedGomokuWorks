At present, foreign language education reform is in full swing. Many people think that foreign language education is not as important as it used to be. Perhaps foreign language education at the university stage is not essential.
We are in total opposition of this viewpoint. I believe that foreign language plays an important role in our life and it is necessary at the tertiary level.
Firstly, as the most universal language int the world, English plays a more and more significant role in university studentsâ€™ study. With the rapid development of information technology and the widespread adoption of Internet, we can easily find a better education via the Internet. However, having a good master of English is of great necessity if you want to have access to these state-of-the-art technology and better education. Cousera, aimed at providing the best education in the world, offers totally 1702 online courses from the famous universities worldwide. Among these courses, 1257 courses use English and only 5% of them have Chinese captions. Moreover, the state-of-the-art technologies as well as famous journals and papers, are also written and published in English. According to statistics, almost 65% of the worlds' influential journals use English, which gives English a high status in academia. Therefore, the study of professional knowledge is becoming increasing associated to the master of English.
